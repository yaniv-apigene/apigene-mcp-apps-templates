All I have to say is, wow. First I was using my Claude Max sub and I used all of my limit quickly, so today I had my claw bot setup a proxy to route my CoPilot subscription as a API endpoint so now it runs on that. It's the fact that claw can just keep building upon itself just by talking to it in discord is crazy. The future is already here\"\n\n@jonahships_](https://x.com/jonahships_/status/2010605025844723765) [![AryehDubois](https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=AryehDubois&background=FF4D4D&color=fff&size=88)\n\n\"Tried Claw by @steipete. I tried to build my own AI assistant bots before, and I am very impressed how many hard things Claw gets right. Persistent memory, persona onboarding, comms integration, heartbeats. A few minor wrinkles remain, but the end result is AWESOME.\"\n\n@AryehDubois](https://x.com/AryehDubois/status/2011742378655432791) [![markjaquith](https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=markjaquith&background=FF4D4D&color=fff&size=88)\n\n\"I've been saying for like six months that even if LLMs suddenly stopped improving, we could spend *years* discovering new transformative uses. @openclaw feels like that kind of \\\"just had to glue all the parts together\\\" leap forward.
